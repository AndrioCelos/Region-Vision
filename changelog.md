Version 1.2 – 9 March 2015
--------------------------

* Updated for the Terraria Server API version 1.17.
* I now use the RegionDeleted hook to inform users immediately and descriptively when a region they are viewing is deleted. It turns out I can't use RegionEntered and RegionLeft, because they don't work when regions overlap.

Version 1.1 – 21 July 2014
--------------------------

* Added the `/rvn` command
* Added help text to all commands
* Fix: deep paint is now used instead of normal paint, which shows on more tiles.

Version 1.0 – 1 July 2014
-------------------------
